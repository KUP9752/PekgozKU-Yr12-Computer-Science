in python declaring a global variable at the start and use it in a subroutine, it will assume the 
one in the function is a new local variable and the print function at the end would print the
original initialised value,

In other languages a gloabal variables changed in subroutines are changed globally

A global variable is defined in the main program, and can be called my any suborutine, unless a variable with the same name is declared in the subroutine. 
When a variable name is used in a subroutine a local variable will be created to that name.
