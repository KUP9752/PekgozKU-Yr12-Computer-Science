programs are more easily and quickly written:
Large programs are broken down into subtasks that are easier to program and manage
Each module can be individually tested
Modules can be re-used several times in a program
Large programs are much easier to debug and maintain
it helps when lots of people are working on one program at one time, each person can be doing a module/subroutine.
