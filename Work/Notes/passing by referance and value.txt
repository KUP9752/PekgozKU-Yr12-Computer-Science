Passing by value copies the data into the function, not ideal when the data we are using is very large

Passing by referance copies the address of the argument into the parameter of the function/procedure, so it doesn't take too much space by copying

def proc1(By val:x, By ref:y):
	x = x -2
	y = 0
#end procedure

m = 8
n= 10
proc1(m,n)
print(m,n)

here m gets copied into x, and x becomes 6 (becaue 8-2=6) however, m stays as 8.
but when n gets passed by referance into y, its memory address becomes y, so when the program realises y is a reference it goes to the address and changes n into 0.
so when we print m and n,  n has become "0" and m stays the same

we generally dont want to pass by referance as we lose the initial data
